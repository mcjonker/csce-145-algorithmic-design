This Repository contains my projects from CSCE-145 Algorithmic Design I course at the University of South Carolina

- RandomDice is a program that will output the results of rolling a 6-sided dice the entered number of times.
- BelowAverage will intake the average temperatures over a period of time, determine the average, and which days were below the average temperature.
- BinaryAdder adds two user-entered 4-bit binary values, and determines their value in decimal.
- CircleSort allows a user to input the radius of a desired number of circles, form a database of those circles, and then view the database sorted by each circle's area (from largest to smallest or vice versa).
- DateArbiter allows a user to input a date and arbitrates if the date exists. This works for future and past dates and is expecially designed for determining if a leap year exists in a given year.
- RockPaperScissors is a coded version of the classic game, where a user can play against a computer in a best-of-three game of Rock Paper Scissors!
- TrianglePrint is a simple command line print method that will print asterisks forming a triangle based on an inputted horizontal height.
- VowelSort analyzes a user-inputted string (sentence) and counts how many of each vowel (A, E, I, O, U) are used, then prints to the console how many of each vowel were used in a sorted order.
- MatrixArbiter allows a user to enter two matrices of compatable dimensions and add their individual components into a resultant matrix.
- MatrixFlip exemplifies the method of horizontally flipping a matrix's data in a simple coding example.
- AppleArbiter is a simple program that shows the user of multiple classes and the testing of their functions.
- CoffeeArbiter tests the use of accessors, constructors, and mutators. Users can enter coffee types and their caffeine contents and then can use additional methods to determine if the items are equal (duplicates).
- DateAndTime is a simplification of DateArbiter that uses a driver (driver written by JJ Shepherd) in conjunction with the code of DateArbiter to use multiple classes to call separate functions of the date verfication process.
- CollisionArbiter is a program that uses a driver (driver written by JJ Shepherd) in conjunction code of CollisionArbiter to test for the collision of two user-defined circles by their diameters and positions as they move around based on the user-defined directional velocities.
- BicycleBuilder users a driver (driver written by JJ Shepherd) to test the creation of a bike (object) made up of several other objects (a frame and two wheels). This tests object oriented construction on a second level.
- SandwichArbiter allows users to construct two peanut butter and jelly and then check if they are identical. A simple object-based project that will make you hungry after spending too much time in it.
- LaundryArbiter allows a user to enter their clothes and note their colors, storing in different drawers of a dresser based on what the type of clothing entered is. Each drawer holds up to 10 articles of clothing for a maximum of 50 total items stored (at 5 drawers).
- StringHelper tests the use of static methods with a few fun outputs.
